# 🌍 Land Use and Land Cover Change Detection Using NDVI 📊

![NDVI](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/NDVI_Visualization.png/800px-NDVI_Visualization.png)

Welcome to the **Land Use and Land Cover Change Detection Using NDVI** repository! This project aims to analyze and detect changes in land use and land cover over time using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI is a powerful tool in remote sensing that helps assess vegetation health and monitor land cover changes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/hemngardihemngardi12345/Land-Use-Land-Cover-Change-Detection-Using-NDVI/releases). Once downloaded, execute the necessary files to begin your analysis.

### 📦 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hemngardihemngardi12345/Land-Use-Land-Cover-Change-Detection-Using-NDVI.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Land-Use-Land-Cover-Change-Detection-Using-NDVI
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage

After setting up the environment, you can start using the scripts in the `src` directory. The main script to run is `ndvi_analysis.py`. This script performs the following tasks:

1. Load raw data from the `data/raw` directory.
2. Process the data to calculate NDVI values.
3. Visualize the results.

To run the analysis, execute the following command:

```bash
python src/ndvi_analysis.py
```

### 📊 Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to help interpret the NDVI results. You can find them in the `notebooks` directory. Each notebook contains step-by-step instructions for generating visual outputs.

## 🌿 Understanding NDVI

### What is NDVI?

NDVI stands for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. It is a numerical indicator that uses remote sensing measurements to assess whether the target area contains live vegetation or not. NDVI values range from -1 to +1, where:

- Values close to 1 indicate dense green vegetation.
- Values around 0 indicate barren areas of rock, sand, or urban areas.
- Negative values indicate water bodies.

### How NDVI Works

NDVI calculates the difference between the near-infrared (NIR) and red light reflected by vegetation. The formula is:

\[ NDVI = \frac{(NIR - Red)}{(NIR + Red)} \]

This formula allows for the differentiation of vegetation from other land cover types effectively.

## 🌐 Applications of NDVI

NDVI has numerous applications, including:

- **Agriculture:** Monitoring crop health and predicting yields.
- **Forestry:** Assessing forest cover and health.
- **Urban Planning:** Understanding land use changes over time.
- **Climate Research:** Studying the impact of climate change on vegetation.
